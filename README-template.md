## My process
I began by analyzing what side I would begin with as well as how i would implement the design. I started by creating the desktop design. I worked my way from the left to the right ensuring the designs looked as similar as possible. 

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- desktop-first workflow
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

I got to refresh my mind on state handling
I found hsl and hsla intresting and its something I plan to use quite often.
I leant how to host my next js application

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
